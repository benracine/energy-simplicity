# Passive Solar and Compost Power / Heating 

---

# First things first

First, we need a good definition of what passive solar (heating) even means.

I would say that, physically, a passive solar home is the result of a construction process that takes resources and creates a space that someone desires to dwell in.

  // [{Resource}] -> Home
  function(resources) {
    return home;
  }

---

# Definitions continued

This space should act as a function that takes a stream of ambient environmental conditions and "returns" a stream of desireable interior environmental conditions.

Ambient environmental conditions is a multi-variate time series, as are the 

I think another interesting part of the story is the process that takes a passive solar home and converts it back to resources, e.g. the deconstruction at the end of a building's life. I think is an underaddressed area in our linear-minded culture and ignores the loops that exist throughout the fabric of our existence. This process looks something kind of like this:

  // Home -> [{UsableResources}]
  function(resources) {
    return home;
  }
