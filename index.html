# What __IS__ a "passive solar" home?

A passive solar home is a physical object that is the result of a construction process that takes resources and creates a space with conditions that someone desires to dwell in.

```
var wood = {'name': 'wood', 'quantity': 'a smidge', 'cost': 'more than the old days'};
var glass = {'name': 'glass', 'quantity': 'a smidge', 'cost': 'get a loan'};
var insulation = {
  'name': 'insulation',
  'quantity': 'enough to get R-25 in the walls and R-50 in the ceiling', 
  'cost': '$$$'
};
var labor = {...};
var resources = [wood, glass, insulation, labor];

var passive_solar_home = (function constructHome(res) {
  return buildStuff(res);
})(resources);
```

---


# What __DOES__ a "passive solar" home do?

The ambient environmental conditions are a multi-variate time series:
<code class="remark-code" style="font-size: 12px;">
  <div class="remark-code-line">var amb_cond1 = {'time': 'early',  'temp': '34F', '% hmdty': '99%', 'precip': 'rain', 'UV': 0};</div>
  <div class="remark-code-line">var amb_cond2 = {'time': 'middle', 'temp': '33F', '% hmdty': '99%', 'precip': 'rain', 'UV': 0};</div>
  <div class="remark-code-line">var amb_cond3 = {'time': 'late',   'temp': '32F', '% hmdty': '99%', 'precip': 'snow', 'UV': 0};</div>
  <div class="remark-code-line">var ambient_conditions = [amb_cond1, amb_cond2, amb_cond3];</div>
</code>

As are the desired interior conditions:
<code class="remark-code" style="font-size: 12px;">
  <div class="remark-code-line">var des_cond1 = {'time': 'early',  'temp': '72F', '% hmdty': '50%', 'precip': 'no thanks', 'UV': 'some'};</div>
  <div class="remark-code-line">var des_cond2 = {'time': 'middle', 'temp': '72F', '% hmdty': '50%', 'precip': 'no thanks', 'UV': 'some'};</div>
  <div class="remark-code-line">var des_cond3 = {'time': 'late',   'temp': '72F', '% hmdty': '50%', 'precip': 'no thanks', 'UV': 'some'};</div>
var desired_conditions = [des_cond1, des_cond2, des_cond3];
</code>

This space should act as a function that takes a stream of ambient environmental conditions and "returns" a stream of desireable interior environmental conditions. 

```
function climateConditioning(ambient_conditions) {
  return physicalProcesses(passive_solar_home, desired_conditions);
}
```

Further, ideally, it can do this without any additional energy input, hence the term "passive", unlike most homes that an active refrigeration cycle going much of the time, e.g. heat pump and/or AC.

# Semantics

Strictly speaking, being a passive solar house would necessitate that there be __ZERO__ energy input.

Drawing the blinds, shutting shutters, and opening vents could all be considered energy inputs. But, I believe that in practice, it tends to be limited to things that draw __mechanized power__ for substantial time durations. I will allow for tiny modifications given that some of them are likely to have 10, 100, 1000x energy savings multipliers.

This means I'm really allowing my `passive_solar_home` to be a __time-varying object__.

---

# More on Desired Conditions

As shown two slides ago, the stream of environmental conditions has several dimensions. Some of them include: (Temperature::float, Humidity::float, Precipitation::string, UV::float)

The desireable conditions (from informal personal experience) tend to look something like:
- Temperature = 72F
- Humidity = 50%?
- Precipitation = nope, thanks for asking though
- UV = natural light?

Of these precipitation is not particularly interesting, your roof simply needs to work. Humidity is complicated and I'm punting on it at the moment. This leaves UV and temperature.

# Reducing

Therefore, it can now be said that

> This space should act as a function that takes a stream of ambient temperatures and UV conditions and "returns" a desireable stream of internal temperatures.

The desired temperature is a constant 72F and the desired UV is just the ambient light conditions? 

Do I have any amateur sleep scientists or anthropologist in the audience?

# Slices in the "Stream"

If we examine some datetimes throughout the calendar year, we see that our structure needs to do opposite things at times.

- __Winter day__: allow maximum UV in to directly heat space AND to be stored in heat storage devices, minimize air exchange.

- __Winter night__: allow the heat storage devices to dissipate heat to the space, minimize air exchange, minimize external heat exchange, e.g. draw the curtains / blinds.

- __Summer day__: disallow any UV from heating the space or the heat storage devices, allow heat to passively vent out of the top.

- __Summer night__: continue to allow heat to vent out the top, open low vents if ambient below interior and interior above 72F.

---

# Feature Specification

We need some kind of __windows/shutters/curtains__ to provide UV throttling || insulation.

We need heat storage devices.

We need low and high vents to facilitate direct air transfer... but, we don't want unintended heat exchange (lots of insulation to guard against conduction losees and tightly sealed against convective losses).

# Interconnectedness / Nonlinear Optimization

The sizing of the aformentioned components are all functions of geolocation and climate.

Further, the sizing of them all are functions of each other.

Recall that this problem aims to minimize the inner product between the actual indoor environment and the desired indoor environment by controlling the 4 variables above.

One can see that the above is a nonlinear optimization problem... and probably not what your local designer is going about designing your home.

Thus, I'll start to defer to some simpler rules of thumb...

- Insulate the west, north, east, and roof heavily. (R25 on walls, R50 on the roof given today's energy prices)
- Orient the long axis of the building east-west and put most of the glass on the south. (To maximize the ability to collect light/heat in the winter)
- Nighttime insulation on the inside of the glass is a great idea.
- The ability to be able to block light in the summer is also a great idea.

Most CSNW employees live in a location where the heating-degree days >>> cooling-degree days, such that capturing light/heat during the day and then releasing it through the night / evening is a primary design concern.

One can capture heat by building a glass atrium on the south facing wall and heating anything with a high heat capacity (stone, concrete, water barrels)... recalling that black absorbs UV best.

This area can be somewhat "air-tight" from the interior space and be connected to it via high and low vents. 

Opening both at night facilitates heat exchange from the atrium to the interior space.

Note that the building is closed to ambient though, of course.

# A Sidenote on the "mass story"

Finally, recall that all of this focused on the energy side of things, and if one aims to be truly green they would need to address the "mass story" as well and address the process of converting the home back to usable resources, e.g. Home -> [{Usable Resource}].

```
var recovered_resources = (function reclaimHome(home) {
  return breakStuff(home);
})(passive_solar_home);
```

# Compost Heating

While I have your attention thinking about the "mass story", I'd like to divert you to think about compost heating for a moment.

Search "Jean Paine" or "Compost Power" (an entity in Vermont) for good background information.

Compost heating is just "aerobic decomposition".

---

# Compost Heating "Chemistry"

```
high-carbon biomass (think wood chips) + high-nitrogren biomass (think horse manure) + ambient bacteria = heat + C02 + rich soil
```

I find it highly fascinating because:
- It has a good mass cycle story: e.g. biomass -> soil -> biomass -> soil
- The resulting heat profile of a 40 cubic yard pile provides about just the right amount of energy for a tiny energy efficient home's hot water and home heating needs (I'll spare you the calcs, but it's in the ballbark of 20000 btu / (hour vs day?)
- The temperature profile (time-axis) of the compost pile offsets the temperature profile of the ambient winter temperatures nicely.
- The resulting soil is available in early spring just in time for the growing season.

Ok, that's all folks.
